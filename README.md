## Design

This little app helps you look up movies & actors in those movies.  Take a look at the homepage for a list of movies!

TODO: add in a way to simulate long requests
TODO: have some more movies with many more actors ready to go to exacerbate the problem

## Questions

1. How many network requests are we making to load the homepage?
2. How can you make this more efficient?
    -> Clientside solution
    -> Backend solution
3. This is my code, can you review it? What comments do you have about it?
4. For EC, suppose I wanted to include the IMDB rating, how would you go about getting that?

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
